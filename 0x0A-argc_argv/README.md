# 0x0A.C - argc, argv

## Concept
* Passing arguments to main function at runtime
* using int main(int argv, char *argc)
* where argv is the number of argument passed at runtime and argc is the array of arguments.

## Objectives
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
